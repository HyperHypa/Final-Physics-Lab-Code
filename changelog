Iteration 1: Simple pendulum using the Verlet method.

Iteration 2: Coupled pendulum with spring connection.

Iteration 3: Coupled pendulum with shaking board connection.

Iteration 4: Position on the X-axis against time with the kuramoto model (give length of pendulum)

Iteration 5: Angle against time with the kuramoto model (give length of pendulum)

Iteration 6: Position on the X-axis against time with the kuramoto model (give period of pendulum) (using real values)

Iteration 7: Angle against time with the kuramoto model (give period of pendulum) (using real values)

Iteration 8: Coupled spring-mass system
